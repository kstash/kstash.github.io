## About WorkBetter

I've been working on this HR system application (backend part only; currently) which I named it as [WorkBetter](https://github.com/kstash/work-better).

Since I started it as a MSA-looking app in the first place, so actually it's not really a Monolithic &rarr; MSA converted system unlike the generally known MSA systems.

## Then why the sweat with MSA?

I definately had quriosity of handling with MSA but I also desperately needed to have an experience of developing a MSA structured project, since the whole backend developer work markets in Korea is/was requiring **"MSA-experienced"** as almost as an essential property.
