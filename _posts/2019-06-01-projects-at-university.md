# Projects at Korea University

## Hello-Mirror: Creative Challenger Program (CCP)

I applied for this University program (CCP) with a project named [Hello-Mirror](https://github.com/kstash/ccp-hello-mirror), which was inspired by a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE-YvYmlYLU&ab_channel=Ajithvalappil) I was watching at that time.
Our group forked [this](https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Mirror) as a start, created our own type of smart mirror with adding some distinguishable differnces which our university students needed informations by using KORAIL(Korea's national railway company) open APIs and KMA(Korea Meteorological Administration) open APIs for weather forecasting.
